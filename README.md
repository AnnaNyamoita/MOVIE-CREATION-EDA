# project summary




Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun.
 They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 
 
We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and then
 translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what
type of films to create.

# Data and tools used in analysis
Data sets for analysis was provided and and I decided 
to use the following data sets;

       (i)tn.movie_budgets.csv
       (ii)tmdb.movies.csv
       (iii)rt.reviews_info.tsv
        (iv)bom.movie_gross.csv



My project analysed and checked the following to
come up with concrete recommendations;

  1.Checking the most produced genres.

  2.checking if the most produced genres are the most profitable genres.

  3.checking if more production bugdet translates to higher profit

  4.Checking if the runtime can affect the profit.

  5 Checking whether movie rating affect profit.

  6.Checking if time of the year movie is produced affects profit.

# Conclusion.
   *Time in the year movie is produced is important in relation to the profit.

   *Movie rating is an important factor to be considered(depending on the audience ofcourse) to make more returns.

   The most produced genres are indeed the most profitable genres with a high production budget.
